Project - StockMarket_WebApp

-> This is a simple web application created in django. So if you find errors in my code please let me
   know i will try to correct me next time when i work on any django project.

Steps:
Note: Name of virtual environment i have created for this project is 'django_env' 

1. First i Create a user signup and login form in the home page of our web application.
2. When you signup with your detail if these are correct and validated then message will show
   'Your account created successfully!'
3. While you are not logged in the home page will never show you the list of stock names which are
   stored in django built-in database.
4. When you logged-in with your credentials the signup and login form is disappeared and only 5
   stock names will show on the home page and after these stock names there are load
   more button, if you click on that all stock names will appear on the same page(home page).

Note: Admin Login credentials:
	username : admin
	password : rohit

5. Search bar will work only if you are logged in.
6. You can't access stock list if you are not logged-in but you can access detail of the stock using
    slug with url like (127.0.0.1:8000/detail/maruti-1)

Not Done:
	1. Video on detail page of stocks
	2. Downloading data in excel file.

Note: Please give me feedback about my work whether it is good or bad (How much '*' will you give
me out of 5 * ).
Thank You
